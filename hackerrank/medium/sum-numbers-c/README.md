# Sum and Difference of Two Numbers

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

**Objective**

The fundamental data types in c are int, float and char. Today, we're discussing int and float data types. 	

The `printf()` function prints the given statement to the console. The syntax is `printf("format string",argument_list);`. In the function, if we are using an integer, character, string or float as argument, then in the format string we have to write ``%d`` (integer), ``%c`` (character), ``%s`` (string), ``%f`` (float) respectively.

The `scanf()` function reads the input data from the console. The syntax is `scanf("format string",argument_list);`. For ex: The ``scanf("%d",&number)`` statement reads integer number from the console and stores the given value in variable $number$.

To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, the command is `scanf("%d %d", &n, &m)`, where $n$ and $m$ are the two integers.

**Task** 	

Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

1. Declare $4$ variables: two of type int and two of type float. 
2. Read $2$ lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your $4$ variables. 
3. Use the $+$ and $-$ operator to perform the following operations:		
    - Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
    - Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.    



**Input Format**

The first line contains two integers.  		
The second line contains two floating point numbers.		


**Constraints**

- $1 \le $ integer variables $\le 10^4$
- $1 \le $ float variables $\le 10^4$

**Output Format**

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled to $1$ decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int int1, int2;
    float float1, float2;

    // Read integer and float inputs
    scanf("%d %d", &int1, &int2);
    scanf("%f %f", &float1, &float2);

    // Print sum and difference of integers
    printf("%d %d\n", int1 + int2, int1 - int2);

    // Print sum and difference of floats rounded to 1 decimal place
    printf("%.1f %.1f\n", float1 + float2, float1 - float2);

    
    
    return 0;
}

```
